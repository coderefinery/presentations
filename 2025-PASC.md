# The context - Sustainable and FAIR research software

Sustainable: Here not "green”, but the software’s ability to endure, evolve, and remain useful over time.

This includes:

- **Technical sustainability**: the code still runs, produces valid results, and can be extended.
- **Social sustainability**: people can understand, contribute to, and take over the project.
- **Organizational sustainability**: there are processes in place that support its longevity (e.g., training, funding, documentation).

# Research software challenges

<br>


- Many researchers write code but lack formal training

- Collaboration on code can be frustrating and inefficient

- Research code is often poorly documented and non-reproducible

- Good/Reproducible coding practices don't have immediate rewards

# Enter, CodeRefinery

**Our mission since 2016:** 

- A community-driven, publicly funded project
- Hands-on training in practical coding tools for research
- Focus on “good enough” software practices to improve efficiency
- Support for Open Science and FAIR software development

# Modular lesson material

We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)/[sphinx-lesson](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson) to build our lessons from Markdown.

<!--
Sphinx format with all markdown, no slides, multi-collaborator effort, built
around exercises, minimum one larger exercise per lesson, solutions in
dropdown, discussion suggestions, instructor guide, making things citable is
WIP, ...

# Our workshops - interactive & hands-on

<img src="img/BYOC.png"
     alt="Graphical representation of the setup of a CodeRefinery workshop with lessons on stream, learners individual, in a team or local classroom and interaction via notes"
     style="width: 100%;" />

- **Format:** Online first
- **Hands-on exercises** - Not just lectures, but hands-on tool experience
- **Bring your own team/classroom** - Learn alongside peers with local support
- **Programming language and domain agnostic** - is the goal
- **Beginner-friendly** - No prior experience with the tools we teach required!

---

# Collaborative document: Markdown

- Interactive, anonymous, parallel, async
- New question every 1-2 minutes!
- ASCII-graph feedback

<img src="img/notes.png"
     alt="Screenshot of exercise title and questions in collaborative notes"
     style="width: 100%;" />

We publish Q&A for each workshop: [Example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/questions/)

# Success stories and impact

### Tested in [10 large online and 28 in-person](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/) workshops

- We reach over [500 persons/year](https://coderefinery.org/about/statistics/)
- Over [30 instructors / speakers](https://coderefinery.org/about/contributors/)
- Over [100 helpers / exercise leaders](https://coderefinery.org/about/contributors/)

.remark["Thank you for six great days of learning Git, testing, modular code, Sphinx (!) and more. I already started incorporating Sphinx in my current project."]

.remark["I write my codes now in such a way that the person who will be taking over my job would have less time figuring out what is going on."]
