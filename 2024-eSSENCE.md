# Lesson example: Testing

We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)/[sphinx-lesson](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson) to build our lessons from Markdown.

<img src="img/screenshot_testing_lesson_tabs.png"
     alt="Screenshot of a lesson in Sphinx format, showing tabs for different programming languages"
     style="height: 450px;"/>
]

We demonstrate GitHub actions for automated testing.

<!--
Sphinx format with all markdown, no slides, multi-collaborator effort, built
around exercises, minimum one larger exercise per lesson, solutions in
dropdown, discussion suggestions, instructor guide, making things citable is
WIP, ...
-->

## Another example: Git lesson

## Workshop setup

<img src="img/BYOC.png"
     alt="Graphics that summarizes how learners can participate a CodeRefinery workshop"
     style="width: 700px;"/>

- lessons are streamed
- individual learners:
     - do the exercises on their own
     - interact via the collaborative document
- teams or classrooms, may be remote or on-site
     - do exercises together
     - interact with the team leader, helpers, and instructors via the collaborative document

## Collaborative document: Markdown

- Interactive, anonymous, parallel, async
- New question every 1-2 minutes!
- ASCII-graph feedback
