# Content for today

<br>

- The CodeRefinery project

- CodeRefinery workshops

- How to engage with, contribute to, and benefit from the resources

# The problem - Research code challenges

<br>

- Many researchers write code but lack formal training beyond programming

- Collaboration on code can be frustrating and inefficient

- Research code is often poorly documented and non-reproducible

- Good coding practices are often not part of standard academic training

# Relation to Research Software Engineering

- We teach topics which are .emph[helpful for researchers] and .emph[essential for RSEs]

- Visiting a CodeRefinery workshop can spark interest in RSEng

- Connecting made easy: [CodeRefinery community chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) also hosts the Nordic-RSE community!
