Title: CodeRefinery - supporting your research software development journey

Draft:

Reproducibility and openness is becoming of ever more crucial importance in
any research ecosystem. In physics as in many other domains, research often
relies on software written as a by-product, and it is an essential part of the
research workflow. However, software is often overlooked from the
reproducibility point of view. This can come from many reasons, like the focus
being on research publications and data rather than software. It can also
originate from researchers not being adequately prepared to write reusable and
sustainable software. The CodeRefinery project (https://coderefinery.org/)
aims at supporting researchers to write reproducible and sustainable research
code no matter their domain or career stage.

Come and hear how the CodeRefinery workshops can help you get started with
tools and practices that will enhance the reusability and sustainability of
your software, such as version control, documenting and sharing code, modular
code development, automating testing, etc. The workshops are held twice a year
online, are free of charge and open to all researchers regardless of their
field, background or experience in developing software.

Finally, CodeRefinery is not just workshops, it also is a community of people
that enjoy helping others write better code and use computing resources
efficiently. The community is tightly-knit to Nordic-RSE
(https://nordic-rse.org/), an association of Research Software Engineers in
the Nordics and Baltics. So if you care about software and are curious to hear
what Nordic-RSE and CodeRefinery are up to, come and talk to us.
