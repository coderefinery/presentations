## Experiences from teaching basic RSE skills with CodeRefinery

CodeRefinery is a project funded by Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration (NeiC) supporting students and researchers 
across all research fields by teaching FAIR research software and development and basic Research Software Engineering practices. 
The initiative has successfully held interactive hands-on online and free workshops for over 300 registrants at a time. 
The workshops combine livestream, co-teaching, parallelized and threaded questions and answers as well as parallel connected in-person events. 
Switching from the traditional online teaching strategy required adjusting to alternative technologies and mindset. 
This contribution aims at sharing our current teaching strategy as well as our lessons learned from developing our workshop style 
and open lesson materials over the years.

## Audience

The CodeRefinerys lesson topics are aimed at researchers to acquire a basic level of RSE skills. 
RSEs of many levels might be interested in the lessons and workshop in order to built the materials into their own lessons or conribute to the materials. 
The workshop strategies may be of interest to everyone involved in teaching any kind of computational topics.
