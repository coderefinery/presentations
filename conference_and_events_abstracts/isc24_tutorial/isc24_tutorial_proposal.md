# ISC '24 tutorial submission

* Deadline: 08.12.23
* ISC - Tutorials: 12.05.24

## Description

### General Information

**Title of the tutorial**: Best Practices in HPC Training
**Tutorial author(s) information**: SW, MJ, DI, TW, RB, ...

### Abstract (Maximum words: 200)

This tutorial will focus on helping competent practitioners and experts teach
their knowledge to learners. It will also serve as a kickstart to teach existing
community-developed open-source training lessons on topics in HPC, software
engineering, machine learning, etc. Building on instructor training resources
developed within the CodeRefinery project and The Carpentries, the tutorial
will cover 1) the science and philosophy of teaching; 2) how to teach
interactive, hands-on workshops; 3) how to design interactive, hands-on
training lessons; and 4) how to effectively organise in-person or online
workshops.

After attending this tutorial, participants should:

- Have increased confidence in teaching interactive workshops in online and in-person settings.
- Be familiar with important pedagogical concepts and scientific findings about how people learn new skills.
- Appreciate the importance of frequent hands-on practice in building skill.
- Understand how learning can be improved by following certain best practices in interactive teaching.
- Know how to design training material and exercises based on intended learning outcomes.
- Know about important differences between online and in-person training and how inherent challenges in online training can be overcome.
- Be familiar with a technical approach to collaboratively developing open source lessons based on a template.
- Know how to measure the success of the training course by collecting feedback during and after the course.

### Detailed description of the tutorial content (Maximum pages: 3)

**Overview and goals of the tutorial (takeaways for the audience)**

This tutorial will cover best practices in developing training material and
delivering technical training workshops. Participants will get acquainted with
key concepts from pedagogical science and the philosophy of teaching, learn
practical methods for teaching interactive and engaging hands-on workshops
which maximise learning through careful consideration of cognitive load,
acquire skill in developing effective training lessons that facilitate memory
consolidation, and get practical tips and tricks on how to effectively organise
in-person or online workshops.

After attending this tutorial, participants will:

- Have increased confidence in teaching interactive workshops in online and in-person settings.
- Be familiar with important pedagogical concepts and scientific findings about how people learn new skills.
- Appreciate the importance of frequent hands-on practice in building skill.
- Understand how learning can be improved by following certain best practices in interactive teaching.
- Know how to backwards-design training material based on intended learning outcomes.
- Know about important differences between online and in-person training and how inherent challenges in online training can be overcome.
- Be familiar with a technical approach to collaboratively developing open source lessons based on a template. 


**Targeted audience**

Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs to be able to
do to some degree, since everyone has their own personal specialties they will
either teach or mentor.

This course can be relevant for different learner personas:

- **You run a practical teaching program** at your institution (for example as part of a research computing group) and would like to learn best practices for collaborative teaching of technical topics, so that you aren’t re-inventing the same thing over and over again.
- **You are a technical specialist** who is frustrated with the way you currently try to teach others who need to use your software or infrastructure. You can’t spend too much time to become a professional, but you know you need something more than what you’ve been doing. Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.
- **You’ve been teaching alone**, but would like to join a internal/national/international collaboration network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication of effort.
- **You are interested in teaching CodeRefinery/ENCCS/... lessons**, and would like a comprehensive kick-start to how these workshops work, either to join and teach with us, or teach our lessons independently.

**Description of hands-on activities, if applicable**

The tutorial will include ample time for a variety of hands-on activities.
Participants will be split into groups already during the first morning session
where they take turns to teach a short snippet of a technical topic to each
other - e.g. the Unix command line - followed by providing feedback to each
other. This experience will form a baseline. In following sessions,
participants will be split into groups of varying sizes to collectively
brainstorm and discuss pedagogical concepts or provide feedback to recorded
teaching demonstrations.  There will also be technical exercises where
participants learn how to use the Sphinx Python package to develop training
lessons in a team using collaborative workflows in Git.  In the final hands-on
activity, participants will again teach a topic to each other in groups and
provide feedback, and reflect on how the concepts learned during the tutorial
have affected their teaching compared to the baseline.

**Updates from previous presentations, if applicable**

This tutorial was taught over two half days to around 30 participants in an
online training workshop targeting the EuroCC network on September 28-29, 2023
(https://enccs.se/events/best-practices-in-online-and-in-person-training/). The
feedback from this workshop was exceptionally positive, with an average rating
of over 9 out of 10 and 100% of participants reporting that they would
recommend the training to their colleagues.  For the ISC tutorial, some of the
exercises will be adapted to the in-person setting, and other minor
improvements will be made to further improve the flow of the training.

**Number of attendees from previous tutorials, if applicable**

Around 30 participants attended the online workshop delivered on September
28-29 2023. This will be the first time the tutorial is taught in-person at
ISC.

**URLs to sample slides and other material**

The training material - which will be somewhat updated before the tutorial -
can be found at https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/.

## Logistics

**Length of the tutorial: half-day (3.5 hours) or full-day (7 hours)**

full-day 7 hours

**Percentage of content split as beginner/intermediate or intermediate/advanced**

50% beginner/intermediate, 50% intermediate/advanced


**Requirements for attendees (e.g., laptop, remote server account)**

- laptop
- (optional, maybe) Python installation with some libraries, alternatively cloud
- 30 minute preparation time

**Estimated number of attendees (with short explanation, if applicable)**

Based on interest in the previously taught versions of this course, we would expect around 30 learners. To keep the tutorial as interactive, inclusive and hands-on as possible, we would like to limit the number of participants to about 40.
