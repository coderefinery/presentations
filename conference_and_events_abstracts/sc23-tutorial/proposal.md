# Abstract

In 2020, most courses and training projects transitioned from in-person to
online teaching. However, many attempted to use in-person strategies online.
CodeRefinery started this way, but soon scaled up and developed a new model of
online teaching. This model combines live-streaming, co-teaching, parallelized
and threaded questions and answers, and parallel in-person events followed via
stream. This strategy has been applied to teaching events with over 500
registered participants. It requires not only adjusted technology but also an
adjusted mindset for the course's purpose and outcome.

During this tutorial session, we will share our strategy and lessons learned,
and discuss how they can also benefit the HPC community. We will demonstrate
live how an interactive stream workshop functions by providing part of the
workshop via a stream and providing interaction for everyone via a
collaborative document. As a full hands-on activity, we will work with
participants to set up an optimal screen-share and encourage them to share
their experiences. At the end of the session, we will demonstrate how we
archive the tutorial outcomes and make them publicly available.

Our main goal for this tutorial is to improve the online training experience,
both for large and small-size workshops.

# Detailed description of the proposed tutorial


## Tutorial goals

We will attempt to showcase one way of how the future of online teaching could
look and show and tell about our strategies and tools that helped to develop a
successful teaching strategy with which we can provide interactive workshops
with over 300 participants at the same time. While from the organizers
perspective the workshops are held online, participants can get an in-person
experience without the organizational burden of organizing an in-person event.
We are convinced that the lessons learned are valuable also for smaller events
of 20-30 participants or more.


## Relevance for conference attendees

Due to the pandemic, almost everyone had to shift from in-person to online
teaching and adapt their methods, including the HPC community. This tutorial
will allow people who faced this challenge to come together and share
experiences and lessons learned, strengthening their skills for remote
teaching. The strategies and tools utilized in this tutorial can also be
applied to other circumstances, such as mentoring, meetings, and
presentations.


## Target audience

The target audience for this tutorial are teachers of technical courses and
workshops (computation and/or programming), who are interested in novel ways
of hybrid/online teaching. However, also
researchers/students/developers/research software engineers belong to the
target audience to learn about presentation strategies and new ways of sharing
materials online and learn about existing materials on the topic.


## Content level

This tutorial provides content for everyone: from beginners in teaching to
experienced teachers. Also participants that do not do any teaching are
expected to learn something new that can be applied to presentations about
computational topics as well.


## Audience prerequisites

There are no technical requirements for the tutorial. Participants will get
the best experience if they can bring a laptop with a web browser and
terminal. The actual implementation and functionality of the terminal and
which software is available through it, will not be important.


## Tutorial content

This tutorial is proposed for half a day. The schedule is planned as follows:

- Introduction (20-30 min)
- Presentation: We join a stream session as team (45 min) and follow a presentation on "The future of teaching"
- Demo/hands-on: Setting up a high-quality screen share (45 min)
- Break (30 min)
- Presentation: Preparing a workshop and teaching (45 min)
- Discussion: Q&A and next steps (45 min)


## Cohesion measures

All presenters have been teaching in cross-national and cross-organizational
contexts together before. Part of this tutorial is the demonstration of
co-teaching technique which has been proven to work very well in CodeRefinery
workshops, which means that no one ever teaches alone, but there is always at
least 2 people having a discussion rather than one person presenting. This
ensures an entertaining atmosphere. We will also provide all the materials on
a common website which will be made available under a reusable open-source
license. We will avoid separate and disconnected slide decks.

# Hands-on feasibility check/analysis

Participants will be able to shape parts of the tutorial by collaborating with
presenters in room and online through a collaborative document which we will
use for questions, notes, and live feedback. During the tutorial every
participant will get the opportunity to discuss and set up an optimal screen
share for online teaching with materials, command line, and collaborative
document.
