# CR at PASC25 Minisymposium 

**Minisymposium title:** "Building Expertise for Sustainable Scientific Software in high-performance computing: Bridging Training Gaps in the Research Community"

**Minisymposium abstract:** 

The aim of this mini-symposium is to explore how training initiatives in sustainable open-source scientific software development foster collaboration among researchers and developers. 

Scientific software development requires motivated, multi-talented individuals capable of balancing technical excellence with scientific rigor. However, the absence of standard curricula for scientists developing software, undefined career paths, and scarce resources for onboarding and maintaining sustainable software make recruiting and nurturing new talent particularly challenging.

The scope and complexity of software skills required are growing rapidly, with software increasingly interdependent on evolving hardware. Traditional academic education often fails to adequately equip researchers for developing sustainable, efficient scientific software. In response, multiple initiatives have emerged over recent years to bridge this gap and provide advanced training to researchers from varied career stages and disciplines. We have invited representatives from some of these initiatives to talk about the topic from their perspective and discuss how we can foster collaborations between the training, researcher and developer communities. We welcome researchers of all scientific domains, and representatives of all training and scientific software developer communities to join us.

### CodeRefinery abstract


Training for Sustainable and Collaborative Scientific Software Development

CodeRefinery is a community-driven initiative that equips researchers and students across disciplines with essential research software engineering skills
to develop sustainable, open, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) software. Funded in-kind by multiple Nordic organizations 
and the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeiC), CodeRefinery addresses critical gaps in traditional academic education by providing hands-on training
in version control, reproducible research, collaborative development, and efficient coding practices that foster Open Science. 
Our workshops are designed to be accessible and scalable, featuring live-streamed and recorded sessions with interactive participation 
via collaborative documents. All training materials (available at https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) are open-source, 
ensuring reusability and adaptation by the broader research community. By working with local partners, 
CodeRefinery fosters an interactive and collaborative learning environment, overcoming challenges associated with large-scale and online teaching. 
This community-driven approach has enabled the joint organization of specialized workshops, such as high-performance computing (HPC) kick-off and 
“Tools and Techniques for HPC”, addressing a wide range of computational research needs. 
Through these efforts, we contribute to a growing ecosystem of training initiatives that empower researchers to build sustainable and 
reusable research software.
