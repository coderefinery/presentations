## Title: How and why we completely changed our CodeRefinery Git lessons

In the CodeRefinery project teach all the essential tools which are usually
skipped in academic education so everyone can make full use of software,
computing, and data with focus on reusability, reproducibility, and openness.

Git and GitHub are central tools in our workshops and before our latest
workshop in March 2024 (https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/),
we have completely changed our Git lessons to a new format:
- Start from GitHub instead of on the command line.
- Start from an existing repository instead of with an empty one.
- Only on second course day we move to local work on the laptop.
- Offer several tracks to participate in the lesson (GitHub, VS Code, command
  line, RStudio) and learners can choose which one they want to follow.
- Use a new example where we collaboratively edit a cooking recipe book.

We did this because we felt that starting on the command line with an empty
repository does not match anymore how researchers work today. Instead we start
from an existing repository and introduce concepts like code review and pull
requests already on day 1.

In this short presentation we will discuss the motivations for the rewrite,
the rewrite process, and also the feedback we received from the learners and
instructors.


## Prerequisites

Attendees will benefit from having some experience with Git and GitHub.
However, no technical detailed knowledge is required.

Experience with learning Git or teaching Git will be helpful to fully engage
with the content.


## Outcomes

We hope that the attendees can give us feedback on our new Git lessons and the
process of how we did this. We also hope that we can inspire others to rethink
how they teach Git and GitHub.


## Accessibility

I will follow the excellent guidelines provided at
https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/policies/accessibility/. In particular, I
will make sure that the material has a reusable license and that all visual
material has a textual description.


## Hybrid Delivery

I do not foresee any issues with streaming my presentation.  In order to make
sure that both remote and in-person participants have a comparable experience,
we will encourage both remote and in-person attendants  to ask questions and
give comments using an online tool (e.g. Slido).
