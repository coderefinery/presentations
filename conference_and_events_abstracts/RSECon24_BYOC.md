# Bring your own classroom to a CodeRefinery workshop

Abstract:
CodeRefinery is a project teaching FAIR research software and development 
and basic Research Software Engineering practices to students and researchers across all research fields. CodeRefinery is a collaboration between universities and organizations in the Nordics funded by Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration (NeiC).

Our workshops are streamed and recorded so that anyone can follow them. Registered participants also have the possibility to interact with the instructors on stream via a collaborative document. The open source materials (available at https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) include lectures as well as hands-on activities. Sharing reusable training materials is one of the projects core values.

CodeRefinery works with local partners to facilitate an interactive and collaborative workshop despite the challenges of large audiences and online teaching. The local partner provides an online or in-person room with a team-lead. The participants watch the stream together and discuss and work on exercises in the group under guidance of the team lead.
This approach enables local partners to provide participants with a full workshop while maintaining the benefits of discussing and working together as a group.

This contribution will describe a workshop setup for scaling an interactive workshop to a few hundred participants while still keeping the interaction and community experience of a local small workshop. We kindly invite YOU to join our next workshop as a learner, team-lead or local partner.

Prerequisites:
The CodeRefinerys lesson topics are aimed at researchers to acquire a basic level of RSE skills. RSEs of many levels might be interested in the lessons and workshop in order to built the materials into their own lessons or conribute to the materials. The workshop strategies may be of interest to everyone involved in teaching any kind of computational topics to a larger audience.

Outcomes: 
Attendees can learn from our experiences and find out about advantages and challenges of our approach to large scale online workshops.
