# What have we learned?

- The format is new and confusing 

- Exercise session .emph[timing is crucial]

- Collaborative document needs to be managed

- .emph[Clearly communicate] what learners are supposed to be doing

- Feedback from local hosts is invaluable for further developing the format, **Thank you <3**

# Benefits of bringing your own classroom

- Get the .emph[interactivity] of own classroom without organizing a full course

- Get onboarding and orientation

- .emph[Side quests] according to own work/need

- Work with .emph[own people] - direct support and help-line

- .emph[Train-the-trainer]: We can help you to get started

- .emph[Community] as test-bed: Let's try out new ideas together
