# Relation to research software engineering

- We teach topics which are .emph[helpful for researchers] and .emph[essential for RSEs].

- [Nordic RSE](https://nordic-rse.org/) colleagues hang out and discuss on the
  [CodeRefinery community chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/)

     style="width: 650px;"/>
]

## Scaling with Community support - Bring your own classroom

- (local) partners host a "watching party"
- online or in-person
- maintaining sense of community for streamed workshop
- own team lead as support
- supportive and comfortable group environment

---

# Collaborative document: Markdown

- Real time *interaction* between learners and instructors 
- Anonymous, parallel, asynchronous
- New question every 1-2 minutes!
- ASCII-graph feedback

     style="width: 100%;" />

We publish Q&A for each workshop: [Example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/questions/)

[...]
[BYOC] allowed us to advance with the **implementation of our vision** for
Research Data & Software Management training and the implementation of TU Delft
Research Software Policy by providing high quality and well-received training
on FAIR software practices. 

The involvement of our data stewards, software engineers and trainers as
helpers in the CodeRefinery workshops have also provided them with a **great
opportunity to continuously improve their skills** and learn from this great
community. 

The CodeRefinery learning materials are **openly available and of excellent
quality**. We often refer our researchers to use them as consultation materials
on our websites and/or guides.

[...] a significant challenge: those that didnâ€™t read carefully the workshop
description on our website expected us to be the instructors and higher
levels of interactivity with them. Besides this point on expectations
management, I think your format really **allows to reach the biggest possible
audience**, while also fostering the **creation of local communities**. We had
in-room discussions during the breaks and created a local chat channel for
the participants. That was used also in the following days while they were
testing the skills learned on their setups. We were **inspired by your format**
in designing ours for the BioNT project.

.quote[
[...] As a person taking the course from home during the pandemic I thought it
was a bit difficult to motivate myself all along the 6 half days. This is
probably why I thought it could be interesting to organize rooms here at NTNU
in order to have people sitting, talking, sharing and helping each other, ...
One of the biggest **challenge is to keep the whole classroom from first to last
day** ... I think it's impossible ðŸ™‚ [...] 

I would assume that **in person course** would definitely be more successful ...
However, I understand the difficulty when the instructors come from different
countries and when you want to offer the workshop for free!

.quote[
[...] We organized a physical room with everyone around one big table attending
together in a kind of hackathon style, with our employer kindly sponsoring
lunch and coffee to keep us going. Through the CodeRefinery online training, my
participants were taken **from no or very basic knowledge of scientific coding
tools and practices** to using version control, unit tests and collaborative
workflows in the scientific work. [...]

I think the most challenging part for me was perhaps on the second run to
facilitate the second of the two weeks, where the format had just been changed
to less hands-on exercise based and more discussion based. [...]

In general, I believe **attending these workshops as a group helped tremendously**
compared to attending individually (and compared to my fall back solution of
teaching people individually which is always less effective due to other
commitments, distractions etc.) due to being able to learn together and discuss
in person with team mates.

# What we have learned

- Dedicated host needed

- The format is new and confusing

- Exercise session timing is crucial

- Collaborative document needs to be managed

- Week 1 vs week 2, exercises vs demo

- Feedback from local hosts is invaluable for further developing the format, Thank you <3

# What is in it for you?

- .emph[Joining is easier than organizing]:
  It is easier to bring 10% to an event than to organize the 100% yourself

- .emph[Material / Experience exchange]: let's not reinvent the wheel

- .emph[onboarding and orientation]

- .emph[Side quests] according to own work/need

- .emph[talk to own people] - direct support and help-line

- .emph[Train-the-trainer]: we can help you to get started

- .emph[Community as test-bed]: let's try out new ideas together

# Many ways to join the experience

- **Join our upcoming workshop** starting next week
- Tell your students and researchers about it (become an ambassador)
- Use our material and give feedback
