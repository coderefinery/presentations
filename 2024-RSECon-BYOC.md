# Problem with large streamed workshops?

Interactivity & sense of community

     alt="Graphics that shows how workshop participants can hear and see the instructors on stream but the instructors cannot hear or see the participants. This is indicated by an arrow with a speech bubble and an eye going from the CodeRefinery stream indicated by a box with two figures with glasses and hats and the words git to a crowd of figures. Another arrow from the crowd to the instructors shows a question mark"

     alt="Hand drawn graphic in grey and purple showing the CodeRefinery livestream on the left with two instructors teaching git, on the right hand side, the three workshop participation modes are shown: individual learners, online classroom and local classroom, in the middle a telescope is shown indicating that everyone watches the stream, underneath an large arrow with the words interact and notes are shown indicating that interaction between instructors and learners happens via collaborative notes. Small arrows between learners in the local and online classroom indicate another level of interaction."

day** ... I think it's impossible ðŸ™‚ [...]

(Candy Deck, NTNU, NO)

.quote[
[...] In general, I believe **attending these workshops as a group helped tremendously**
compared to attending individually [...] due to being able to learn together and discuss
in person with team mates.

# What have we learned?

- The format is new and confusing

- Exercise session .emph[timing is crucial]

- Collaborative document needs to be managed

- .emph[Clearly communicate] what learners are supposed to be doing

- Feedback from local hosts is invaluable for further developing the format, **Thank you <3**

# Benefits of bringing your own classroom

- Get the .emph[interactivity] of own classroom without organizing a full course

- Get onboarding and orientation

- .emph[Side quests] according to own work/need

- Work with .emph[own people] - direct support and help-line

- .emph[Train-the-trainer]: We can help you to get started

- .emph[Community] as test-bed: Let's try out new ideas together
