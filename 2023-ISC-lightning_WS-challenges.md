### Lecturer notes
Why reverse hybrid
- Issue with hybrid:
     - People onsite ≠ people online.
- Large courses: 
     - most students don't have time to ask a question f2f
     - they chat with the teacher anyway
- Reverse hybrid:
     - Teachers via video and chat
     - Students in onsite groups
     - Those who want interaction can get it
     - The course isn't bound to one location, anyone can attend.
- This is actually scaling up!

### Lecturer notes
- Many things also before and after
- Explain how to join
- We removed Zoom teams because a lot of work
     - Some people got less interactivity
- With Zoom teams:
     - drop-offs lead to too small teams or event empty rooms -> rearranging people creates overhead
- Collaborative document 
     - might crash or user errors
     - Needs a few people to maintain / oversee

# Workshop preparation – Technical side

Computing".


### Lecturer notes
- Many moving parts
- Zoom + OBS
- Sound levels have to be checked
- New bottlenecks: 
     - The Q&A is actually the thing that we worry the most (not the stream so much)
          - We may have even

# Scaling up

- Meeting expectations: some want walkthrouhgs and some want proper problem-solving exercises
- there will be more people with technical problems which leads to overhead in solving them
- Difficult to achieve a common understanding on topics
- Level of teaching: with massive courses all participants won't have the same prerequisite level
     - Always taking the novices into account leads all courses being basic course
- How to know how people are doing?
     - We don't see them, only the document
- Certificates: how do we assess what people have been done?
- .emph[Coordination effort] starts to outweigh lesson preparation and teaching
- Volunteer retention and building long lasting relationships takes effort
- Over 30 instructors/speakers, Over 100 exercise leads (not in one event)
