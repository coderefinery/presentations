# Lessons

We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)/[sphinx-lesson](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson) to build our lessons from Markdown.

     alt="Screenshot of a lesson in Sphinx format, showing tabs for different programming languages"
     style="height: 500px;"/>
]

<!--
Sphinx format with all markdown, no slides, multi-collaborator effort, built
around exercises, minimum one larger exercise per lesson, solutions in
dropdown, discussion suggestions, instructor guide, making things citable is
WIP, ...
-->

## Another example: Git lesson

# Collaborative document: Markdown

- Interactive, anonymous, parallel, async
- New question every 1-2 minutes!
- ASCII-graph feedback

<img src="img/notes.png"
     alt="Screenshot of exercise title and questions in collaborative notes"
     style="width: 100%;" />

We publish Q&A for each workshop: [Example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/questions/)

# Connection to high-performance computing

- Many partners with HPC involvement

- Aalto University very active in inviting others to join HPC kickstart

- [Tuesday Tools & Techniques for High Performance Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/ttt4hpc-2024/)

- [ENCCS instructor training](https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/) -> Materials based on CR train-the-trainer

- NRIS (Norway) and LUMI (EuroHPC-JU) have adopted our training approach and material as template

- We started sharing tools across borders at https://github.com/nordichpc

# What we have learned

## About motivating/teaching

- Teaching isn't a lecture anymore. It's more
  .emph[like a live TV production], which *can* be as interactive as people in
  a room.

- .emph[Co-teaching] is a great way to onboard, get better quality, and reduce
  stress

- .emph[Good enough practices] better than perfect practices not
  applied

- Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side
  effect good for others"

---

# What we have learned

## About scaling

- .emph["bring your own classroom"] seems to be a way to scale

- .emph[Installation instructions and on-boarding] become more important

- We don't "see" classrooms -> .emph[feedback mechanism] in Q&A doc

- Make exercises longer to .emph[give classrooms the chance to interact]

---

.left-column50[
## Future: Community project

- .emph[Communicate value] for volunteers and organizations

- Research groups send their students to us instead of
  creating isolated material

- .emph[More collaboration] with similar projects ("helper exchange program")

- Governance is .emph[community-driven]
]

.right-column50[
## Teaching format

- Continue .emph[large-scale workshops]

- Support .emph[local events]

- More asynchronous content coupled with online events
  (".emph[flipped classroom] approach")
]

## How you or your organization can participate

]

- **Join our next workshop** autumn 2024; follow our [newsletter](https://coderefinery.org/about/newsletter/) to get involved
- Tell your students and researchers about it
- Send one or more **exercise teams** or **join as observer**
- Use our material and give feedback

---

# What is in it for you?

- .emph[Joining is easier than organizing]:
  It is easier to bring 10% to an event than to organize the 100% yourself

- .emph[Material exchange]: let's not reinvent the wheel

- .emph[Train-the-trainer]: we can help you to get started

- .emph[Community as test-bed]: let's try out new ideas together
