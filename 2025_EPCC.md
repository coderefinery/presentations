# The problem - Research code challenges

<br>

- Many researchers write code but lack formal training beyond programming

- Collaboration on code can be frustrating and inefficient

- Research code is often poorly documented and non-reproducible

- Good coding practices are often not part of standard academic training

# Success stories and impact

### Tested in [10 large online and 28 in-person](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/) workshops

- We reach over [500 persons/year](https://coderefinery.org/about/statistics/)
- Over [30 instructors / speakers](https://coderefinery.org/about/contributors/)
- Over [100 helpers / exercise leaders](https://coderefinery.org/about/contributors/)

.remark["Thank you for six great days of learning Git, testing, modular code, Sphinx (!) and more. I already started incorporating Sphinx in my current project."]

.remark["I write my codes now in such a way that the person who will be taking over my job would have less time figuring out what is going on."]
