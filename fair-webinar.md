### Benefits of the Carpentries membership and coordination

- Provide a progression
- Make CodeRefinery visible to the Carpentries community
- Collaboration on teaching to reach people who are difficult to reach
- Provision of priority seats for instructor training

## A vision of reaching many people at once

## Scaling up during 2020: effective team work

<img src="img/scaling-up.png" style="width: 50%;"/>

- Before 2020: ~25 participants, ~2 helpers
- Now: routinely 100+ participants, 20+ helpers
- Lectures & code-along exercises in the main room: .emph[stream and also record]
- Get help and group exercises in a breakout room
- Participants can register as teams (.emph["bring your own breakout room"])
- Installation sessions and helper preparation sessions
- Asynchronous Q&A via [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) ->
  we publish these ([example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-10-20-online/#questions-answers-and-feedback))

## Recent feedback

> "I take this chance to congratulate once more for the very appreciated workshop.
> I really enjoyed all the sessions, this is something I have been looking for
> for a couple of years now and that I will strongly advertise between my
> colleagues.  In particular, I would like to congratulate you for your
> professionalism and for having made the most of all the potential of distance
> learning, without ever complaining about its obvious and unnecessary
> limitations. The team effort during the classes was impressive. Also, the
> material available to support the classes is excellent and I am sure I will
> exploit it in the future."

- ["Towards FAIR principles for research software", Lamprecht et al., Data Science, vol. 3, no. 1, 37-59, 2020](https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-190026)
- Also: documentation, code review, version control for dependencies


### FAIR principles have many aspects

- Principles
- Best practices
- Policies
- Governance model
- Development of tools
- .emph[Training] (version control, notebooks, documentation, code review, version control for dependencies, licenses)
- .emph[Mentorship]

# What is CodeRefinery?

## CodeRefinery's biggest development may not be *teaching*...

## ... is it *teaching together*?

---

## CodeRefinery 2022: .emph[Community project]

Primary tasks:

- Classic "CodeRefinery workshops" with focus on best software practices, organized by partners
- Own training: both open tracks and sponsored personalized courses
- Coordinate other shared collaborative training events
- Train the trainer

Additional goals:

- Continue coordinating Carpentries events in Nordics/Baltic countries
- Driving Nordic research software engineers (RSE) network
- "Training support" of NeIC, for other projects
- Support professional development of RSEs
- Improve towards a more inclusive community and better gender balance
