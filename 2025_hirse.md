# The problem - Research code challenges

.left-column50[
- Many researchers write code but lack formal training.
- Collaboration on code can be frustrating and inefficient.
- Research often relies on poorly documented, non-reproducible code.
- Good coding practices are often not part of standard academic training.

# What we teach: Practical skills for researchers

We teach topics which are .emph[helpful for researchers] and .emph[essential for RSEs].

- **Git & Version Control** ‚Äì No more lost files or confusion over changes.
- **Reproducible Research** ‚Äì Ensure results can be verified and reused.
- **Collaborative Coding** ‚Äì Work efficiently with colleagues & open-source communities.
- **Efficient Coding Techniques** ‚Äì Write cleaner, modular, and scalable code.
- **Documentation & Testing** ‚Äì Make your code understandable and error-free.
- **Open Science & FAIR Principles** ‚Äì Share your work for maximum impact.

# Success stories and impact

### Tested in [10 large online and 28 in-person](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/) workshops

- We reach over [500 persons/year](https://coderefinery.org/about/statistics/)
- Over [30 instructors/speakers](https://coderefinery.org/about/contributors/)
- Over [100 helpers/ exercise leaders](https://coderefinery.org/about/contributors/)

.remark["Thank you for six great days of learning Git, testing, modular code, Sphinx (!) and more. I already started incorporating Sphinx in my current project.]

.remark["I write my codes now in such a way that the person who will be taking over my job would have less time figuring out what is going on."]
