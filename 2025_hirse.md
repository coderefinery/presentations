## CodeRefinery: A Community for Teaching, Learning, and Growing Together

Samantha Wittke, CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland

#### HiRSE seminar, March 2025

# Content for today

<br>

- The CodeRefinery project

- CodeRefinery workshops

- The community

- How to engage, contribute, and benefit from our resources

---

# The problem - Research code challenges

<br>

- Many researchers write code but lack formal training

- Collaboration on code can be frustrating and inefficient

- Research code is often poorly documented and non-reproducible

- Good coding practices are often not part of standard academic training

# Enter, CodeRefinery

**Our mission since 2016:** 

- A community-driven, publicly funded project
- Hands-on training in practical coding tools for research
- Focus on ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù software practices to improve efficiency
- Support for Open Science and FAIR software development
