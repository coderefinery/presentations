# Relation to research software engineering

- We teach topics which are .emph[helpful for researchers] and .emph[essential for RSEs].

- [Nordic RSE](https://nordic-rse.org/) colleagues hang out and discuss on the
  [CodeRefinery community chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/)

- [**Join our next workshop** September 2024](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/)
- Tell your students and researchers about it (become an [ambassador](https://coderefinery.org/join/individuals/#coderefinery-ambassador))
- Provide a local classroom or **join as observer**
- Use our material and give feedback

---

# What is in it for you?

- .emph[Joining is easier than organizing]:
  It is easier to bring 10% to an event than to organize the 100% yourself

- .emph[Material exchange]: let's not reinvent the wheel

- .emph[Train-the-trainer]: we can help you to get started

- .emph[Community as test-bed]: let's try out new ideas together
