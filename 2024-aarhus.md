- Community


### Relation to research software engineering

- We teach topics which are **helpful for researchers** and **essential for RSEs**
- [Nordic RSE](https://nordic-rse.org/) colleagues hang out and discuss on the
  [CodeRefinery community chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/)

## Research software engineers

.. are people who combine .emph[professional software expertise] with an .emph[understanding of research] .cite[https://researchsoftware.org/]

- Often people **who grew up in research** and liked computing and programming

- ... or people **who come from software development** drawn towards meaningful and impactful work of academia


### About the term "RSE"

- Term "research software engineer" was coined in 2012 at the Collaborations Workshop organized by the Software Sustainability Institute.
- [Podcast celebrating 10 years of RSE](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/celebrating-10-years-rse)
- [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/)
- Recent conference: [RSECon 2024](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/)
- May 2024: First [Nordic-RSE](https://nordic-rse.org/) conference.

## How has the role of RSEs changed in academia

- Students and researchers who work on RSE, often in isolation, without knowing about the RSE community, and often not credited for their RSE work
- RSE appears as job title
- Centralized RSE groups appear as support units


## What future trends might we expect?

- .emph[Career paths] for RSEs
- More academic .emph[credit] for open science and reusable software
- More collaboration between RSEs and university libraries
- RSEs have access to .emph[grant applications] and can build their own groups
- Organizations which recognize this early will have a .emph[competitive advantage]

# Learning software engineering craft in the age of AI?

With the rise of AI, how do we ensure that essential software engineering
skills are not overlooked? How do we balance the excitement around AI with the
need for robust software infrastructures?

---

- transition from laptop to supercomputer
- transition from one researcher to the next
- diversity: take ownership of system quality, performance, and ethical considerations like bias and fairness
- critical thinking
- being able to adapt requires being able to understand
- AI generated result might not optimize for being easy for humans to understand and transform
- erosion of creativity and innovation?
   - but then again it can be like seeing somebody else work and learning new things from them
- craftsmanship and skill mastery
- tool dependency and lock-in
- being able to share knowledge: papers, data, code, models, licensing, reusability

# Thoughts about how to support career development of RSEs

How can institutions support RSEs in developing sustainable academic careers,
particularly in light of the hybrid roles many of them occupy (part researcher,
part engineer).

---

- 70/20/10 model
- encourage open-source work
- encourage own research and own funding applications
- working one or two days a week in a research group (or vice versa)
- exchange programs
- ability to build own groups
- X-Y problem
- talking to people instead of email only
- encourage sharing work and credit sharing work
- Give staff the .emph[freedom to experiment] with the tools they are expected to teach.
- .emph[Exchange programs] for staff to learn from other institutions.

# Fostering collaboration between RSEs and researchers

What are some best practices for fostering collaboration between RSEs and
researchers, and how can these be scaled across different institutions and
disciplines?

---

- guiding/mentoring instead of just doing
- choice of language/technology: maintainability
- funding silos
- time reporting and cost objects
- identify those who want to help and allow them to
- exchange programs
- co-teaching
- conferences
- RSE conferences
- researchers collaborating vs IT staff collaborating

# Which competences might be needed in the future?

## Which competences might be needed in the future?

### Sharing work with your future self (and others)

- Papers, data, code, models, dependencies, computational steps.
- Dependency management and .emph[containerization] (operating system inside a file).
- Navigating the licensing landscape.


### Learning and training others

- We all need .emph[training in how to train] and how to mentor.
- .emph[Co-teaching] is a great way to onboard, get better quality, and reduce
  stress.
- .emph[FAIR practices] also for training material.
- For technical topics, the lone lecturer with their own private PowerPoint/PDF
  slide deck might be a thing of the past.


### Being able to decommission services

- Papers are "forever" but services are not. The main skill in decommissioning
  is possibly communication.
