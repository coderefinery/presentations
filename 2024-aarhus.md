## What is CodeRefinery?

- A hub for FAIR research software practices
- A project since 2016, currently funded by [NeIC](https://neic.no/)
- Training network
- Reaching about [500 learners/year](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/)
- Reusable [lesson materials](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)
- Community


### Relation to research software engineering

- We teach topics which are **helpful for researchers** and **essential for RSEs**.
- [Nordic RSE](https://nordic-rse.org/) colleagues hang out and discuss on the
  [CodeRefinery community chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/)

.left-column80[
- Co-teaching: Pilot and co-pilot

- Live-streamed and recorded

- Emphasis on high quality screen-share and audio

- Offer multiple paths for learners to choose

- Q&A are written, anonymous, and published

- Collect feedback during and after events

- All our material and output is open source

- Scale with "bring your own classroom"

## Competence building for staff (1/3)

- Teaching isn't a lecture anymore. It's more
  .emph[like a live TV production], which *can* be as interactive as people in
  a room.

- .emph[Co-teaching] is a great way to onboard, get better quality, and reduce
  stress.

- We need to exchange best practices in .emph[installation instructions] and on-boarding.

- There is a case for .emph[self-paced learning using short videos] (e.g. MOOCs). We all
  need collaboration and training in these tools.

---

## Competence building for staff (2/3)

- .emph[FAIR practices] also for training material.

- For technical topics, the lone lecturer with their own private PowerPoint/PDF
  slide deck might be a thing of the past.

- Collaboration requires .emph[communication and coordination]. We need to normalize communication as part of work.

- We all need .emph[training in how to train] and how to mentor.

---

## Competence building for staff (3/3)

- .emph[AI] will bring new users to the door of HPC. We need to be ready to welcome and support them.

- Give staff the .emph[freedom to experiment] with the tools they are expected to teach.

- .emph[Exchange programs] for staff to learn from other institutions.
