## What is CodeRefinery?

- A hub for FAIR research software practices
- A project since 2016, currently funded by [NeIC](https://neic.no/)
- Training network
- Reaching about [500 learners/year](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/)
- Reusable [lesson materials](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)
- Community


### Relation to research software engineering

- We teach topics which are **helpful for researchers** and **essential for RSEs**
- [Nordic RSE](https://nordic-rse.org/) colleagues hang out and discuss on the
  [CodeRefinery community chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/)

## How we teach: <ins>together</ins>

.left-column80[
- Co-teaching: Pilot and co-pilot

- Live-streamed and recorded

- Emphasis on high quality screen-share and audio

- Offer multiple paths for learners to choose

- Q&A are written, anonymous, and published

- Collect feedback during and after events

- All our material and output is open source

- Scale with "bring your own classroom"

# The evolution of research software engineering (RSE)

---

- what is an RSE?
- term is now 10 years old
- How has the role of research software engineers (RSEs) changed in academia, particularly in the social
  sciences and humanities
- what future trends might we expect?

# Learning software engineering craft in the age of AI?

---

With the rise of AI, how do we ensure that essential software engineering
skills are not overlooked? How do we balance the excitement around AI with the
need for robust software infrastructures?

- transition from laptop to supercomputer
- transition from one researcher to the next
- diversity: take ownership of system quality, performance, and ethical considerations like bias and fairness
- critical thinking
- being able to adapt requires being able to understand
- AI generated result might not optimize for being easy for humans to understand and transform
- erosion of creativity and innovation?
   - but then again it can be like seeing somebody else work and learning new things from them
- craftsmanship and skill mastery
- tool dependency and lock-in
- being able to share knowledge: papers, data, code, models, licensing, reusability

# Thoughts about how to support career development of RSEs

---

Insights on how institutions can better support RSEs in developing sustainable
academic careers, particularly in light of the hybrid roles many of them occupy
(part researcher, part engineer).

- 70/20/10 model
- encourage open-source work
- encourage own research and own funding applications
- working one or two days a week in a research group (or vice versa)
- exchange programs
- ability to build own groups
- X-Y problem
- talking to people instead of email only
- encourage sharing work and credit sharing work

# Fostering collaboration between RSEs and researchers

---

What are some best practices for fostering collaboration between RSEs and
researchers, and how can these be scaled across different institutions and
disciplines?

- guiding/mentoring instead of just doing
- choice of language/technology: maintainability
- funding silos
- time reporting and cost objects
- identify those who want to help and allow them to
- exchange programs
- co-teaching
- conferences
- RSE conferences
- researchers collaborating vs IT staff collaborating

# Which competences might be needed in the future?

---

- containerization
- sharing work with your future self
- training
- decommisioning/sunsetting

---

- Teaching isn't a lecture anymore. It's more
  .emph[like a live TV production], which *can* be as interactive as people in
  a room.
- .emph[Co-teaching] is a great way to onboard, get better quality, and reduce
  stress.
- .emph[FAIR practices] also for training material.
- For technical topics, the lone lecturer with their own private PowerPoint/PDF
  slide deck might be a thing of the past.
- Collaboration requires .emph[communication and coordination]. We need to normalize communication as part of work.
- We all need .emph[training in how to train] and how to mentor.
- .emph[AI] will bring new users to the door of HPC. We need to be ready to welcome and support them.
- Give staff the .emph[freedom to experiment] with the tools they are expected to teach.
- .emph[Exchange programs] for staff to learn from other institutions.
